// Days of Development: 3

// Official Begin:

// Official End:
???

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Day 3:
- Added ShaderManager which allows you to get a custom shader by name 
  or a default shader by Shader::Default-ID
- Added Message class which can show a MessageBox (only for Windows right now!)
- Added RenderLayers which have their own renderer, shader and 
  collection of renderables
- Added SpriteGroup class as a container for multiple sprites
- Added a TranformStack to the renderer; This is useful for groups of sprites
  where the child elements should be positioned relative to their parents

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Day 2:
- Added to GitHub
- Added Color Class which (for now) converts a vec4 into an int
- Improved BatchRenderer so that he will create another draw call 
  when there ar too many sprites (up to 500K)
- Added Transform2D class for Renderable2Ds

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Day 1:
- Shader class for loading and handling vertex and fragment shaders
- IndexBuffer class which creates and handles an IndexBuffer Object
- Renderable2D and Sprite classes which wil lbe drawn by a Renderer2D
- Renderer2D class as an abstraction for displaying 2D Objects
- BatchRenderer2D class as an implementation of a fast renderer

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Day 0 (Preparations):
- Compiled GLFW for 64bit
- Simple Window class for GL context handling
- InputManager-, Keyboard- and Mouse-classes for input handling
- Math-Utils for Vectors, Matrices and other math stuffs
